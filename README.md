### What I learned

_Skill Enhancement_

As I embarked on this journey of web development, my foundational skills in HTML and CSS blossomed, solidifying my understanding of these essential elements. Simultaneously, I delved into the world of SASS, mastering its capabilities to seamlessly compile it into CSS. My appreciation for accessibility principles deepened, and I embraced semantic HTML coding practices to enhance the inclusivity of my web creations. Additionally, my introduction to Gulp opened up a new realm of automation, streamlining my development workflow. These newfound skills, coupled with my knowledge of Markdown, acquired while crafting this README file, have equipped me with a well-rounded skillset, enabling me to craft accessible, efficient, and visually appealing web applications.

### Next Steps

With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am ready to embark on the next stage of my frontend development journey by delving into React and Redux Toolkit. These powerful frameworks will elevate my skills and enable me to create interactive and data-driven web applications. I am eager to explore the possibilities that React and Redux Toolkit offer, further expanding my knowledge and proficiency in frontend development.
